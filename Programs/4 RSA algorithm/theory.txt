RSA Algorithm:
RSA algorithm is a public key encryption technique and is considered as the most secure way of encryption. 
It was invented by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman in year 1978 and hence name RSA algorithm.

The RSA algorithm holds the following features − 
RSA algorithm is a popular exponentiation in a finite field over integers including prime numbers.
The integers used by this method are sufficiently large making it difficult to solve.
There are two sets of keys in this algorithm: private key and public key.

RSA algorithm uses the following procedure to generate public and private keys: 
Select two large prime numbers, p and q. 
Multiply these numbers to find n = p x q, where n is called the modulus for encryption and decryption. 
Choose a number e less than n, such that n is relatively prime to (p - 1) x (q -1).
It means that e and (p - 1) x (q - 1) have no common factor except 1.
Choose "e" such that 1<e < φ (n), e is prime to φ (n), gcd (e,d(n)) =1 
If n = p x q, then the public key is <e, n>. A plaintext message m is encrypted using public key <e, n>. 
To find ciphertext from the plain text following formula is used to get ciphertext C. 
C = m^e mod n Here, m must be less than n. 
A larger message (>n) is treated as a concatenation of messages, each of which is encrypted separately.
To determine the private key, we use the following formula to calculate the d such that: 
De mod {(p - 1) x (q - 1)} = 1 Or De mod φ (n) = 1 
The private key is <d, n>. A ciphertext message c is decrypted using private key <d, n>. 
To calculate plain text m from the ciphertext c following formula is used to get plain text m. m = c^d mod n
