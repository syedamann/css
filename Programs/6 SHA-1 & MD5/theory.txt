MD5

The MD5 hash function produces a 128-bit hash value. 
It was designed for use in cryptography, but vulnerabilities were discovered over the course of time, 
so it is no longer recommended for that purpose. 
However, it is still used for database partitioning and computing checksums to validate files transfers.

Algorithm 
Step1: Append Padding Bits ï‚· Padding means adding extra bits to the original message. 
So in MD5 original message is padded such that its length in bits is congruent to 448 modulo 512. 
Padding is done such that the total bits are 64 less, being a multiple of 512 bits length.

Padding is done even if the length of the original message is already congruent to 448 modulo 512. 
In padding bits, the only first bit is 1, and the rest of the bits are 0. 

Step 2: 
Append Length After padding, 64 bits are inserted at the end, which is used to record the original input length. 
Modulo 2^64. At this point, the resulting message has a length multiple of 512 bits.

Step 3: 
Initialize MD buffer. A four-word buffer (A, B, C, D) is used to compute the values for the message digest. 
Here A, B, C, D are 32- bit registers and are initialized in the following way

Step 4: 
Processing message in 16-word block MD5 uses the auxiliary functions, 
which take the input as three 32-bit numbers and produce 32-bit output. 
These functions use logical operators like OR, XOR, NOR.


SHA-1

SHA stands for Secure Hash Algorithm. 
The first version of the algorithm was SHA-1, and was later followed by SHA-2 (see below).
Whereas MD5 produces a 128-bit hash, SHA1 generates 160-bit hash (20 bytes). 
In hexadecimal format, it is an integer 40 digits long. 
Like MD5, it was designed for cryptology applications, but was soon found to have vulnerabilities also. 
lAs of today, it is no longer considered to be any less resistant to attack than MD5.
